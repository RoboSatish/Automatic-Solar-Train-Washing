# Automatic-Solar-Train-Washing

A solar train-washing project was made with the help of available material. Convectional train washing contain maximum worker with more water and time consuming.

In this project, contain high pressure atomized nozzle which consume less current so we use solar energy for it. Hence, electricity problem will remove. By using dc motor pump and nozzles pole on both side of train. When train will come slowly on washing platform slowly then controller button press then nozzle will on and high pressure nozzle on both sides. Washed water goes to bottom tank here filter it and reuse for spraying.

 

# WORKING

Train mounted on circular track which moves rounded solar plate creates electricity from sunlight. Electricity generated from solar controlled by control kit and proper voltage provide to battery. Sensor use for sensing the proper position of railway on track.

 Battery used for storage current, all connections of solar, dc pump, brush motor, battery is connected with controller. When the train coming on washing track slowly then start the switch of controller, Start dc pump, motor and brush motor simultaneously and high pressure water from nozzle spray on train both side and rotary brushes can be cleaned further by rotary action.  Washed water reused by using filter or net, then this water stored in reservoir tank for reuse.

# Components

1.      Train 
2.      Nozzles
3.      Control kit
4.      Solar panel
5.      Dc motor and pump
6.      Platform (play wood)
7.      Battery
8.      Ir sensor
9.      Bottom tank and filter
10.      Reservoir  tank
11.   plywood  sheet

# Advantage

1.      Use solar power then electricity problem.
2.      Atomize spray so no worker wills require
3.      Fast washing.
4.      Save extra money and effort of worker.
5.      Rail washing required less time.
6.      Automatically sense the railway on track and operate the nozzles.
7.      Less wastage of water.
8.      Dc pump can be operated solar energy which is free of cost.
9.      Reuse of water.
10.  Low operating and maintenance cost.
11.  Operating possible in both directions for drive through system.
